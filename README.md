# Project-1
I had to create a public main function seprartly for the informed topics that we were told to complie and run.
I added the flag variable to wether indicate if the varibale is true or false in order to implement along with my math function
Boolean and if else statements were needed in order to confirm that if I had a variable besides what im supposed to get it stull runs through the whole funtcion.
I had to set the num -128 greater while the num to be bigger than 127 to set up for the rest of my program
I created seprate intergers for comps 1, comp 2, excess 128, BintoDec, DecToBin. 
I also added the magnitude, complement and some notations.
Lastly I added the scanner and print statments for all the topics listed for what were expecting an output from and also and if else for wether the choice of answers differs as well.
